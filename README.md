# RISC-V MYTH Workshop – Summary

## Workshop Overview
This 10-day workshop, conducted by **VSD** in collaboration with **Redwood EDA**, focused on understanding and building a RISC-V CPU core using TL-Verilog and Makerchip, along with C programming and toolchain setup.

## Key Learnings

- Introduction to RISC-V ISA and basic keywords
- Working with the GNU compiler toolchain in Ubuntu
- Application Binary Interface (ABI) and function call behavior
- Digital logic design using TL-Verilog on Makerchip
- Understanding simple and pipelined CPU micro-architecture
- Concepts like control logic, fetch-decode, and pipeline hazards

## Day-wise Breakdown

- **Day 1**: RISC-V ISA basics, GNU toolchain setup, integer representation (in Ubuntu via Oracle VirtualBox)
- **Day 2**: ABI and lab work using C function calls, basic verification flow
- **Day 3**: TL-Verilog combinational, sequential, and pipelined logic using Makerchip
- **Day 4**: Simple RISC-V CPU micro-architecture – fetch, decode, and control logic
- **Day 5**: Complete pipelined CPU – pipelining stages, handling hazards, load/store logic

## Folder Structure
Each day's work is organized into separate folders (Day1 to Day5) with sandbox links and related files.

## Tools Used

- **Ubuntu (Oracle VirtualBox)** – For C programming and toolchain setup (Day 1 & 2)
- **Makerchip** – For TL-Verilog design and simulation (Day 3 to Day 5)
- **TL-Verilog** – Used to implement and simulate logic and CPU architecture

## Acknowledgement

I would like to thank **Kunal Ghosh Sir** for guiding us throughout the workshop and teaching us during the first two days.  
I also express my sincere gratitude to **Steve Hoover Sir** for his detailed and inspiring sessions during the last three days.  
Special thanks to **VSD** and **Redwood EDA** for organizing this amazing hands-on learning experience.
